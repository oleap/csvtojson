# csvtojson

My result from a node.js course lab.

The project use the csvtojson npm module. It can be installed with "npm i --save csvtojson". It should already be written in the package.json file.

I included a zip which contains all the files including the csvtojson module files. You might be able to download, unzip and use it yourself though I don't know if it'll work for sure.
