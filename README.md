# csvtojson

My result from a node.js course lab.

The project use the csvtojson npm module. It should already be written in the package.json file, so you can install it with the NPM INSTALL command.

You can run this script by:
1. Downloading the files to your computer.
2. Opening your node.js console.
3. Navigate to the project folder.
4. Run: NPM Install
5. Run: node main.js

I included a zip which contains all the files including the csvtojson module files. You might be able to download, unzip and use it yourself though I don't know if it'll work for sure.
